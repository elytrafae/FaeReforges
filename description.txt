This is a mod originally meant to just do things with reforges, but I got so caught up with Summoner, that I decided to add a bit more for them

The mod comes with three new reforge stats!
- Summon Cost, increases/decreases how many slots minions/sentries occupy
- Summon Speed, increases/decreases the speed of minions/sentries
- Summon Crit Chance, gives summons a base crit chance. The mod does not make crit chance from other sources (like Rage Potions) apply to minions

Using these stats, as well as damage and knockback, 21 new reforges were added, exclusive to summoner staves!

Right now, the mod does not follow vanilla's reforge style, and instead all positive reforges are intended to be viable and for them to not overshadow each-other.
For balance discussions, bug reports, etc. please contact me on Discord, under the username "elytrafae". You can also find me on the tModLoader discord!

This mod is inspired by, and partially follows the phylosophy of, Sorbet Cafe's video on reforges (https://youtu.be/UBfoOkhV2vY?si=Jehi5nvXmoSS_KZB). Go check it out!
